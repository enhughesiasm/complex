A game about making human traits for a magical shop everyone visits before being born.

I put this little project together after releasing the book, The Shop Before Life. I wanted a different kind of challenge and I hadn't made a game for a while, so an incremental game based in the prelife while learning a few new things about React seemed like a nice diversion.

The code needs (a lot of) refactoring but it does the job and I've decided my time is better spent using what I've learned on future projects.

I hope you have fun playing.
